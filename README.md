## dl-notebooks

A collection of some notebooks that I've worked on while studying deep learning. Usually simple implementations of well-known algorithms.

### deep-dream.ipynb

Based on Google's Deep Dream algorithm, feed an image into a model trained on Imagenet and then alter the image to maximize a layer of the model. Makes trippy frogs appear in the image.
